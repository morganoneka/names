# Last Name Visualization

As a creative writer, the [US Census Bureau data on surnames](https://www.census.gov/topics/population/genealogy/data.html) has been a valuable resource for coming up with unique names for my characters! It is a lot of data, though, and would be much more useful to others a user-friendly interface. Other websites have similarly visualized this data, but were either lacking in filtering options or did not display ALL 162,000+ surnames.

Therefore, I created this web page. Hopefully others find it useful as well! Feel free to share any issues with the website, or suggestions for additional features.

Plans for future features:
- Filtering by frequency within a certain race
- Randomly selecting surnames
